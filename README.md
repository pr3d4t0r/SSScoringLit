`SSScoringLit` is the driver code for launching the SSScoring family of
applications if hosted from Streamlit.app or Snowflake.

There's no business logic other than pulling a version of SSScoring off PyPI and
launching the application.  These files control the deployment:

- `requirements.txt`
- `app.py`
